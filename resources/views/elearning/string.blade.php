    <div class="short-background">
        • Ancient Origins: The earliest known string instruments date back over 3,000 years, with discoveries like the "Lyre of Ur" from Mesopotamia. <br>
        • Longest Strings: The piano, technically a string instrument, has strings over six feet long in its largest models. <br>
        • Cultural Variations: Instruments like the sitar (India), koto (Japan), and balalaika (Russia) showcase the diversity of string instrument traditions around the world. <br>
        • "Perfect Pitch" Instrument: The violin is often considered the closest instrument to the human voice in tonal range and expression. <br>
        • Material Matters: Early violin strings were made from sheep gut, while modern strings often combine metal and synthetic materials for better durability and sound. <br>
