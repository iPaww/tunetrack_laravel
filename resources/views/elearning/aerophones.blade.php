    <div class="short-background">
        • Oldest Instrument: The world's oldest known musical instrument is a flute made from a vulture's wing bone, estimated to be over 40,000 years old, discovered in Germany. <br>
        • Circular Breathing: Players of instruments like the didgeridoo and certain flutes use a technique called circular breathing, allowing them to produce uninterrupted sound for minutes at a time. <br>
        • Largest Trumpet: The world's largest playable trumpet, measuring over 105 feet long, was created in Germany and requires multiple people to operate. <br>
        • Flute's Versatility: The flute is one of the only instruments found in nearly every culture worldwide, from Native American flutes to the Japanese shakuhachi. <br>
        • Saxophone Origins: The saxophone, a relatively modern aerophone, was invented in 1840 by Adolphe Sax, combining characteristics of both brass and woodwind instruments. <br>
