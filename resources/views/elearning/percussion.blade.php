    <h1>TRIVIA</h1>
    <div class="short-background">
        • Oldest Instrument: Archaeological evidence suggests that simple drums and rattles were some of the first musical instruments used by humans. <br>
        • Largest Family: The percussion family is the most diverse in an orchestra, including instruments like the triangle, maracas, and gongs. <br>
        • Cultural Roots: Percussion plays a central role in many cultural traditions, such as African drumming and Latin American samba. <br>
        • The Gong Mystery: A well-played gong can produce a rich array of overtones, creating an almost "magical" resonance that seems to linger in the air. <br>
        • Silent Partner: Instruments like the tambourine and castanets add subtle, yet essential, rhythmic texture to compositions. <br>
